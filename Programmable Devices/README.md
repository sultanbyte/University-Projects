# Programmable Devices

A State-machine implemented in VHDL to display two modes of sweeping lights on eight consecutive LEDs (the single LEDs, not the seven-segment displays) using only eight states for inputs including the mode switch and reset on an ALTERA DE1-SOC board 

#### Settings & modes of display: 
    ##### Mode 1: one lit LED moves from left to right and wraps around
    ##### Mode 2: one lit LED moves from right to left and wraps around
    ##### Asynchronous reset button (implemented using active-low pushbutton)
